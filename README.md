I managed a Twitter account about German Football and i pull all tweets to website use with API. I noticed, when i wrote flood tweets, then i can't combining these tweets like a content. So, i wrote this little snippet. Thus, i could combined flood tweets in a paragraph.


Here, result and example flood tweet link:
